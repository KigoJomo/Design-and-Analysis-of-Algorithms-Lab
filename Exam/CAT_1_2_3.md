### **Image 1: CAT 2**

1. **Define the following terms as used in design and analysis of algorithms:**
   - **Optimization problems:** Problems where the objective is to find the best solution from a set of feasible solutions, often by maximizing or minimizing some value.
   - **Minimum spanning tree:** A subset of the edges in a weighted graph that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
   - **Brute force:** A straightforward method of solving a problem by trying all possible solutions until the correct one is found.
   - **Base case:** The condition in a recursive algorithm where the recursion stops, typically the simplest possible case for which the solution is known.

2. **Compare and contrast greedy and divide-and-conquer algorithms:**
   - **Greedy Algorithm:** Makes a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, hoping that these choices will lead to the best overall solution. It doesn’t reconsider the choices once made.
   - **Divide and Conquer:** Breaks down a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves each sub-problem independently, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem.

3. **Construct a Huffman tree and find the Huffman codes for the alphabet:**
   - You would create a binary tree where the leaves are symbols, and the path to each leaf represents the symbol's code. The symbols with lower frequency have longer codes.

4. **Encode RMQQSMN using the Huffman codes:**
   - Use the Huffman codes you generated in part c) to encode the string RMQQSMN.

5. **Solve the fractional knapsack problem using the greedy algorithm:**
   - Sort items based on value/weight ratio and select items to maximize the value within the weight limit. Take fractions of items as necessary.

6. **Find the longest common subsequence of strings Y and X:**
   - **Y: BQDRCVEFGH**
   - **X: ABGVDEFGH**
   - Use dynamic programming to find the LCS and calculate its time complexity.

7. **Traverse the graph using breadth-first search (BFS):**
   - Start from a node, explore all its neighbors before moving to the next level, and continue until all nodes are visited.

### **Image 2: CAT 3**

1. **Define the following terms:**
   - **Complete graph:** A graph where there is an edge between every pair of vertices.
   - **Best first search:** A search algorithm that uses a priority queue to explore paths based on a heuristic, often used in pathfinding.
   - **State-space tree:** A tree representing all possible states or solutions of a problem, where nodes represent states, and edges represent transitions.
   - **Pruning:** The process of cutting off branches of the state-space tree that won’t lead to a better solution, thus reducing the number of states to explore.

2. **Generate all permutations of {8, 6, 1, 5} by backtracking:**
   - Use backtracking to list all possible permutations of the set.

3. **Solve the knapsack 0/1 problem by branch and bound:**
   - Apply the branch and bound method to explore the different subsets and choose the one that maximizes the value without exceeding the weight limit.

4. **Apply backtracking to solve the subset sum problem:**
   - **A = {1, 3, 4, 5} and d = 11**
   - Use backtracking to find all subsets that sum up to `d`.

5. **Search the graph using depth-first search (DFS):**
   - Start from a node and explore as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

6. **Apply branch and bound to solve the assignment problem using the cost matrix:**
   - Solve the given assignment problem by minimizing the total cost using branch and bound.

### **Image 3: CAT 1**

1. **Define the following terms:**
   - **Analysis of algorithms:** The process of determining the computational complexity of algorithms, regarding time and space.
   - **Asymptotic notation:** A mathematical notation used to describe the limiting behavior of an algorithm's runtime or space requirements as the input size grows.

2. **Explain four characteristics of divide and conquer algorithms:**
   - Breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
   - Solving each sub-problem independently
   - Combining the solutions of sub-problems to get the solution to the original problem
   - Recursive approach with a base case.

3. **Determine the asymptotic tight bound using the master theorem:**
   - Solve for the given recurrence relations using the master theorem.

4. **Explain merge sort and give its time complexity:**
   - Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. The time complexity is O(n log n).

5. **Perform quicksort on the given list using the first element as the pivot:**
   - Walkthrough the quicksort process, showing each step.

6. **Analyze the given function:**
   - **i) Type:** It’s a linear search.
   - **ii) Function:** It finds the maximum value in an array.
   - **iii) Time complexity:** O(n).

7. **Sort the list C, O, N, G, R, A, T, U, L, A, T, I, O, N, S alphabetically using selection sort and bubble sort:**
   - Apply both sorting algorithms to sort the list and compare their processes.
