## Introduction

In this course, we explore the fundamental algorithms used in computer science. We will learn how to design efficient algorithms, analyze their complexity, and understand their practical applications. This repository serves as a collection of the code and concepts covered throughout the course.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the examples in this repository, you should have a basic understanding of:

- Programming in Java
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Basic mathematics (logarithms, factorials)

## Setup

To set up your environment for running the Java examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Install JDK**: Download and install the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

2. **Install an IDE**: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html).

3. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KigoJomo/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Lab.git
   cd Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Lab
   ```

4. **Open the Project in Your IDE**: Import the cloned repository into your chosen IDE.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes implementations and explanations for the following topics:

- Euclidean Algorithm for GCD
- Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.)
- Search Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence)
- Greedy Algorithms (Huffman Coding, Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms)
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, A* algorithm)
- Divide and Conquer (Matrix Multiplication, Closest Pair of Points)

## Code Examples

### Euclidean Algorithm for GCD

```java
class Example {
    // Euclidean Algorithm
    // To find GCD

    public int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (a == 0)
            return b;
        return gcd(b % a, a);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example example = new Example();
        int a = 15;
        int b = 70;
        int result = example.gcd(a, b);
        System.out.println("The GCD of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + result);
    }
}
```
